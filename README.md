Hello! I'm ``__delattr__``, a 15-year-old self-taught tech enthusiast from Slovakia diving into the world of computer science since 2018. My adventure started with Luau programming on Roblox, where I crafted UI libraries and took on exciting projects. In 2023, I took a dive into the world of Python, adding another layer to my coding journey.

I have a thing for the artistry of coding, especially when it gets a bit esoteric. Unraveling complexities and exploring the creative side of programming is where I find my joy.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-weight: 500;">Used languages</h3>

Primarily <b>Lua</b>, <b>Python</b>
I'm also familiar with the fundamentals of <b>C</b>, <b>C#</b> and <b>x86 Assembly</b>
